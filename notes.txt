Notes on Dakota

================================================================================
The four import/export formats are:

text_archive (TA): Plain-text, machine-readable archive for re-import or use
with the surfpack executable.

binary_archive (BA): Binary, machine-readable archive for re-import or use with
the surfpack executable.

algebraic_file (AF): Plain-text, human-readable file intended for use with
user-created tools; not compatible with Dakota or the surfpack executable.

algebraic_console (AC): Print the model in algebraic format to the screen; not
compatible with Dakota or the surfpack executable.


These global surrogates can be exported in the following formats:

gaussian_process (surfpack): TA, BA, AF, AC
neural_network: TA, BA, AF, AC
radial_basis: TA, BA, AF, AC
polynomial: TA, BA, AF, AC
experimental_gaussian_process: TA, BA
experimental_polynomial: TA, BA
moving_least_squares: TA, BA
mars: TA, BA

No other surrogate models can be exported.
